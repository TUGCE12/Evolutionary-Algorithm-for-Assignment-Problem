# Evolutionary-Algorithm-for-Assignment-Problem

Using evolutionary algorithm design, we will search for the best STATE vector (or matrix) that maximizes the fitness function f.

The problem we are dealing with here is the product distribution problem.
You can find the relevant explanations in the assignment_2.pdf file.
The codes are in the b.py file.
